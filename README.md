# Hangman
* My third project made with [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/)
* It is simple game where the player has to guess a word, letter by letter, in a limited number of attempts.
* During this project I learned a basic stuff in Python like how to use loops, types of variables, conditions and If statements, functions and of course rules of writing a clean code.
## Setup
* To work with project you need Python version 3.x
* To run program simply use ```hangman.py```
